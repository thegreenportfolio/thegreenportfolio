  <h1>The Green Portfolio – Privacy Policy</h1>
  <p><em>Last updated: January 2026</em></p>

  <h2>1. Introduction</h2>
  <p>
    The Green Portfolio (“we”, “our”, or “us”) builds privacy-first mobile apps and
    websites focused on movement, play, and learning.
    Respect for your privacy is a core design principle across all our products.
  </p>

  <h2>2. Scope</h2>
  <p>
    This Privacy Policy applies to:
    <br>• All apps published by The Green Portfolio
    <br>• All websites and subdomains operated by The Green Portfolio
    <br><br>
    This includes (but is not limited to) Bike Ride Green, GOAL! GOAL! GOAL!,
    Learning Maze, and future apps.
  </p>

  <h2>3. Personal Data</h2>
  <p>
    Our apps are designed to work <strong>without accounts</strong>.
    We do <strong>not</strong> collect, store, profile, or sell personally identifiable
    information (PII).
  </p>

  <h2>4. App Data</h2>
  <p>
    Any data generated inside our apps (such as activity, progress, scores,
    routes, or statistics) is stored <strong>locally on your device</strong>.
    It is never transmitted to our servers.
  </p>
  <p>
    You may delete this data at any time by clearing app data or uninstalling
    the app.
  </p>

  <h2>5. Location Data</h2>
  <p>
    Some apps may request access to location services to enable core functionality
    (for example, route tracking).
    Location data is used <strong>only while the app is in use</strong> and remains
    on your device.
  </p>

  <h2>6. Website Analytics</h2>
  <p>
    Our websites may use basic analytics or advertising tools (such as Meta Pixel)
    to understand general traffic patterns and improve visibility.
    These tools do not provide us with personally identifiable information.
  </p>

  <h2>7. Third-Party Services</h2>
<p>
  Some apps published by The Green Portfolio may use third-party services
  to provide specific functionality, such as advertising, analytics related
  to advertising performance, or mapping features.
</p>
<p>
  These services are used only where necessary and in accordance with
  their respective privacy policies. We do not sell user data, and we do
  not share personally identifiable information with third parties.
</p>
<p>
  Data shared with third-party services is limited to what is technically
  required for the feature to function (for example, ad delivery or map
  rendering) and is not used by us for profiling or tracking across apps.
</p>

  <h2>8. Children’s Privacy</h2>
  <p>
    We do not knowingly collect data from children under the age of 13.
    Our apps do not require accounts or personal details.
  </p>

  <h2>9. Data Sharing</h2>
  <p>
    We do not sell, rent, or share user data with third parties.
    If you choose to export data from an app, that action is fully under your control.
  </p>

  <h2>10. Changes to This Policy</h2>
  <p>
    This Privacy Policy may be updated if our products or legal requirements change.
    Updates will be published on this page with a revised date.
  </p>
